<h1 id="iron-elements">iron-elements</h1><p>Basic building blocks for creating an application.</p>
<h2 id="Roadmap">Roadmap</h2><h3 id="Elements_in_progress">Elements in progress</h3><ul>
<li><code>iron-list</code> - the upgraded version of a virtualized infinite list, previously named <code>core-list</code>. ETA: Couple weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Elements_planned">Elements planned</h3><p><em>Elements we’re planning on building soon but haven’t started yet</em></p>
<p>[Currently focused on getting all elements up to speed]</p>
<h3 id="Elements_not_planned,_notably">Elements not planned, notably</h3><p><em>Elements we’re not planning on building as part of this product line, but that one might be wondering about</em></p>
<p>A number of elements existed as <code>core</code> elements that are not in this product line:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>core-action-icons</code> - This wasn’t really an element, and wasn’t particularly heavily used.</li>
<li><code>core-animation</code> - The animation-related elements that were part of core will be created as part of the <code>neon</code> product line.</li>
<li><code>core-docs</code> - Deprecated: use <a href="https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-doc-viewer"><code>iron-doc-viewer</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>core-drag-drop</code> - Not currently working on.</li>
<li><code>core-dropdown</code> and <code>core-dropdown-menu</code> - These were confusing UI to have in <code>core</code>, so we’ve moved them to the <code>paper</code> element set for now and made them easier to customize. More on the thought process behind this change in the <a href="https://blog.polymer-project.org/announcements/2015/05/14/updated-elements/">blog</a>.</li>
<li><code>core-focusable</code> - This has been re-implemented using Polymer behaviors - see for example the <code>paper-radio-button-behavior</code> in <a href="https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-behaviors"><code>paper-behaviors</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>core-item</code> - This had UI opinion, so was re-implemented as <a href="https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-item"><code>paper-item</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>core-layout</code> - We’re working on more stable, consistent layout elements.</li>
<li><code>core-overlay</code> - This is re-implemented as a behavior, in <a href="https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-overlay-behavior"><code>iron-overlay-behavior</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>core-popup-menu</code> - This element wasn’t particularly of unique value, so we’re putting it away for now.</li>
<li><code>core-scroll-header-panel</code> - This had UI opinion, so it’s been moved to <a href="https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-scroll-header-panel"><code>paper-scroll-header-panel</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>core-splitter</code> - This element was relatively trivial, so we’ve put it off for now.</li>
<li><code>core-style</code> - This element is not useful with Polymer’s new styling system. Check out the latest docs for more.</li>
<li><code>core-tooltip</code> - This will become <code>paper-tooltip</code>.</li>
<li><code>core-menu</code> - This had UI opinion, and will become <code>paper-dropdown-menu</code>.</li>
</ul>
